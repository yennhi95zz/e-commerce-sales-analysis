## Getting Started
To run the code in this repository, you will need to have Python 3 and the following libraries installed:

- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- plotly

You can install these libraries using pip:
`pip install pandas numpy matplotlib plotly`

In addition, you will need to download the e-commerce sales dataset from Kaggle and save it in the data/ directory. The dataset can be found at the following link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nhiyen/e-commerce-data

## Running the Code
The main code for the analysis is provided in the Jupyter notebook sales_analysis.ipynb. To run the notebook, navigate to the notebooks/ directory and run the following command:
`jupyter notebook`

This will open Jupyter Notebook in your web browser. Click on the sales_analysis.ipynb file to open the notebook and run the cells in order.
